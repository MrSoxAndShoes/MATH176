# MATH 176, Problem 4, Spring 87

**OBJECTIVE**:
* To learn how to read data from an input file (text 3.4)
* To learn how to write results to an output file (text 3.4)
* To learn about logical variables
* To learn about IF statements
* To learn about DO statements.

**PROBLEM**: Modify the rocket problem as stated on page 96 of the text so that the following input data will be read from a data file:
| Line # | Description              | Value |
|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| Line 1 | Total time               |   100 |
| Line 2 | Distance for time change |    50 |
| Line 3 | Initial time increment   |     2 |
| Line 4 | Final time increment     |   0.5 |

The output should look like that shown on page 99 of the text.

The output information should be written to an output file.

**TURN-INS**:
1. A listing of the input file
2. A FTNLIST of the program
3. A listing of th output file
4. A sample hand calculation to verify the program results.

**HINTS**:
- Study the sample programs in the text, Sections 3.4 and 3.5
- Construct the program in two steps;
  - step 1: a correctly operating program using subroutine INPUT for the program input and the terminal screen for output.
  - step 2: change step 1 into the final end-product by changing the input and output to files.
  - A DO loop could be used to solve this problem. FORTRAN 77 on the HP/3000 does have a form of the DO statement as follows:
```
                 DO WHILE (logical expression)
                     .
                     .
                     .
                 END DO
```
