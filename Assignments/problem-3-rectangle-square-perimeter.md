# Problem 3: Rectangle-square perimeter

**Program Description**: Modify problem #44 on page 67 of the text to include
the decision as to whether the rectangle is a square. Write the program
under the assumption that the input always occurs in the same fixed order:

**INPUT**: The coordinates of the four vertices of a rectangle in the following
order: A, B, C, D

```
                        A     w     B
                         ┌────┬────┐
                         │    │    │h
                         └────┴────┘
                        D           C
```

**OUTPUT**: Determine the perimeter of this rectangle and a written statement
as to whether or not it is a square.

```
   Sample Output: The perimeter of this rectangle is = XXXX.XX
                  This rectangle is/is not/ a square.
```
