**REF**: Problem #38,39 in text, Page 129

**Problem Statement**: 48 temperature measurements for two compounds have
                       been taken at 10 minute intervals. These measurements
                       are stored in a data file called TEMP with each pair
                       of temperatures on a new line – stored in the order
                       the measurements were taken. Write a computer program
                       to read the data file and print it under the heading
                       as follows:

**NOTE**: The output information is to be directed to a file.
          I will provide a data file when you are ready – you construct
          a file to test your program

**TURN IN**: FTNLIST of your program
             A copy of your program's output file using my data file.
